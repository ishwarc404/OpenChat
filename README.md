This is a simple socket enabled chat application. The front end is currently vanilla HTML and Js and backend
is supported by Flask.

Feel free to contribute.

Upgrades needed:
1. Need a strong DB to backup chats.
2. Need multimedia support.
3. Need to introduce a content filter.

Issues:
1. Font-size increased back to 40px after reduction till 10, and then gets bumped up to 200px.
